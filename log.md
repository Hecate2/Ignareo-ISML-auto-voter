Oct. 23rd, 2019: To those who sell or rent out my captcha servers carelessly: **PLEASE READ THE LICENSE!**  
A supporting group of a mighty character(not Chtholly) has improved the accuracy of the captcha system, at a heavy cost of CPU time(0.2 to 0.4 seconds per image, using only 1 CPU core) and 1 month of intensive brain work. This might be academically a nice job, but not always the best for actual battles. In my opinion, reducing the cost of I/O should still be the priority for most spammers. You may find a more impeccable pretreatment for captchas to reduce the number of images downloaded. Those owning professional techniques, nuclear power plants and tons of powerful GPUs can try **scene text recongnition** to achive ultimate accuracy and download one captcha image.  
I'm still waiting for ISML to take **effective** anti-spamming measures. Effective measures have to be carried out for the survival of ISML. If a 'Moore's Law' can be kept by spammers, then in Oct. 2020, it will be likely that people scan billions of free proxies from the Internet with `masscan` or `zmap`, and a bandwith of no less than 10Gbps.  
  
Oct. 21st, 2019: `libuv`最高！  
  
Sep. 25th, 2019: ISML, ありがとう。  
**Contact me to apply for IgnaleoG.py. It can bypass Cloudflare IUAM fireawall, and utilize your proxies at a much higher efficiency.** Certainly I am not to offer it for free to the evil opponents of Chtholly.  
Civil uses of IgnaleoG are welcomed! Just don't attack Chtholly in all kinds of saimoe events.  

Sep. 19th, 2019: Please do not start thousands of selenium browsers in a few seconds. They exhaust the output bandwidth of ISML.  
Today I spammed no more than 130 votes after Misaka Mikoto asked me for a manual vote but I encountered 3 session expires in a row.  
Please switch to latest technologies to save the hardware resources of ISML, which does good to everyone. I believe IGN causes no expired session even at 200 votes per minute. 
  
Sep. 12th, 2019: I didn't vote any! 麻烦刷紫水晶项链和蓝宝石阶段萌皇赛的人手下留情，别又搞成DoS了  
  
Sep. 3rd, 2019: 曾经我打萌战是为了活着，但萌战使我更加虚无。
  
Sep. 1st, 2019: Thank Chtholly and ISML operators! isml.moe/voting is responding quite briskly today!  
Aug. 30th, 2019: I've improved IGN. The new file name is IgnaleoG.py. Currently I'm not in the mood of publishing the enhanced Carillon or using any type for spamming.  
By the way, Maglorは不幸だ~  
  
Aug. 29th, 2019: Please stop DDOS!  
Aug. 28th, 2019: Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?!  
  
(20:28, GMT +8)Aug. 22nd, 2019: GRE test tomorrow morning. Just one manual vote today! Good night.  
(10:50 am, GMT +8)Aug. 22nd, 2019: Gosh! I swear I HAVEN't cast any vote!  
  
Aug. 20th, 2019: I'm planning to spam a few thousands for Shino Asada.  
  
Aug. 16th, 2019: I heard someone spammed billions(I don't know the exact quantity) in Topaz 1!  
ISML operators shall understand that cloudflare does not provide any protection against IGN, though my aiocfscrape hasn't been updated for the latest IUAM firewall.  
And, stop spamming billions! You'll find it meaningless sonner or later.  
Achtung! IGN can burn 180,000 proxies in an hour(50 proxies per second), at ease!
  
Aug. 10th, 2019: ISML is being DDOS attacked at noontime. Hatred is burning.  

Aug. 7th, 2019: I'll not immediately update IGN for the necklace round.  
Aug. 5th, 2019: Hope a peaceful Necklace round (though that's almost impossible)  
  
Aug. 4th, 2019: Still I thank all that contributed for Ch, Ne and Wi.  
  
Aug. 2nd, 2019: 我对事不对人地问一句：某几家大厨你们对轰得爽吗？  
Amused to hear the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Syria has casted a vote! XD  
1000k votes gogogo! **Use your brains to distract other voters with SESSION EXPIRES!**  
  
July 31th, 2019: 不会用圣剑的人不要瞎用！  
Thank you very much for fighting against all the bad civilizations in all kinds of saimoes!  
See the **Tips** at the end of this *README* to camouflage yourself better and cast more effective votes!  
  
July 29th, 2019: >asyncio.ensure_future(self._post('httpc://chtholly.68',data=r'冰柠檬茶'.encode('三分糖')))  
July 28th, 2019: Nice to see no massive spamming votes yesterady.  
July 27th, 2019: **Best wishes for those who obey the rules!**  
  
July 12nd, 2019: **It's quite intelligible that some of you do not believe the enormous scale of auto voting, or you may suspect the performance of my program. That's why I realease:**  
**我知道有的人不相信萌战刷票有多恐怖，或者不相信我的程序投票的速度，所以又发射了这个供吃瓜群众参考：**  
https://github.com/Hecate2/ISML_auto_voter/releases/download/20190125/20190125x32187.PSWD.Rem00.7z  
for your reference. As far as I know, the total number of votes in 24 hours should be at least hundreds of thousands, or millions. The maximum number is quite limited by the hardware of ISML, instead of voting programs.
